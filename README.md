# GOSIM CHINA 2024 Rust Embedded Workshop
Bart Massey

Welcome to the GOSIM CHINA 2024 Rust Embedded Workshop. This
is going to be super-informal and hopefully fun.

We will be playing with writing "bare-metal" code for the
BBC micro:bit v2 (MB2), the board used by the latest Discovery
Book provided by the Rust Embedded WG.

## Schedule

* Hour 1: Talk about embedded stuff, set up hardware, big Blinky action
* Hour 2: Buttons, fancy LEDs, nRF peripherals, maybe sound
* Hour 3-4: Group demo building, lab time

## Resources

Various things to look at and use.
